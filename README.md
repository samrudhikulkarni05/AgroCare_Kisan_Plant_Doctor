AI Analysis
The image is sent to the AI engine (Google Gemini), which analyzes visual patterns using computer vision and ML models.

Disease Detection
The system identifies the crop disease (or confirms healthy status) along with severity level.

Treatment Recommendation
Suitable cure, preventive steps, and farming tips are displayed in a simple, farmer-friendly format.

Weather & Local Support
Farmers can check today’s weather and access local agricultural help for better decision-making.
