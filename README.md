## 🌍 Why We Did Not Use a Database

AgroCare is intentionally built *without* a traditional database to keep things simple, safe, and reliable for farmers.

- *No accounts, no passwords, no complexity:* Farmers never have to sign up, remember credentials, or deal with “technical” issues like logins, OTPs, or failed sessions. The app is open and ready to use from the first click.  
- *Fewer things that can break:* By avoiding a database, there is no risk of “DB down”, corrupted tables, or migration errors. This stateless style makes the system easier to run and more resilient in real-world conditions.[web:34][web:40]  
- *Faster and lighter for rural infrastructure:* Without a database layer, the app needs fewer backend services, which helps keep hosting costs low and performance stable even on modest college/NGO infrastructure.[web:33]  
- *Privacy by design:* Farmer images, audio, and queries are processed in real time and are not permanently stored, which reduces the risk of data misuse and makes farmers more comfortable using the tool.[web:36]  

If required in future, a database can be plugged in for features like follow-up tracking or disease hotspot analytics, but the *current design is optimized to remove all technical friction for farmers* and make deployment as plug-and-play as possible for organizers.
